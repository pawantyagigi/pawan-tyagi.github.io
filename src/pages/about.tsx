              Hi,
              <br />
              My name is Pawan Tyagi. I have over{" "}
              <span id="overall-experience">13</span> years of experience in
              software development and <span id="sitecore-experience">8</span>{" "}
              years focused on Sitecore and digital experience platforms.
              Currently, I work as a <strong>Technical Lead at Altudo</strong>{" "}
              in Gurugram, leading Sitecore engineering delivery across XM
              Cloud, Content Hub, Search, and Helix-based solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a Sitecore 2× certified developer (including{" "}
              <strong>XM Cloud Developer</strong> and{" "}
              <strong>Sitecore 10 .NET Developer</strong>), Sitecore 9 Platform
              Associate Developer, and a{" "}
              <strong>Microsoft Azure Developer Associate (AZ-204)</strong>. My
              toolkit also includes Helix, .NET MVC, Docker, and JSS.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through my blog <em>Insights With Me</em>, I share practical
              Sitecore tutorials and real-world project learnings — from
              publishing and serialization to Search crawlers and Content Hub
              integrations — to help other developers ship with confidence.
            </p>
